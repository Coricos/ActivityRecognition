# Activity Recognition

## Introduction 

My whole project is based on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones) provided for a competition one year ago on Kaggle. My aim was to see if I could improved the results given in the kernels through other methods, such as convolutionnal networks. The first problematic was thus the understanding of their protocol, as I wanted to gather the raw signal corresponding to the given features. The whole development on this repository represents my numerous trials, and the relative performances are given along with it.

## Model tested 

* XGBoost
* RandomForest
* 1D Convolution
* 2D Convolution
* Mixed Neural Networks
